This mod adds several contents about Machine Intelligence & Synthetic Ascended Empire.
Below is list of things that I consider as main contents of this mod.

[h1] Processing Capacity [/h1]
Processing Capacity is a representation of maximum limitation that
Machine Intelligence Empire can control its group members efficiently.

Empire gains advantage or disadvantage as its 'Supply : Demand Ratio' changes.
Advantage or Disadvantage will be shown as an empire modifier.

Put mouse cursor on Research Resources group on topbar (the one next to Unity icon)
to see current supply and demand of Processing Capacity resource.
If it's not displayed, use !!!Universal Resource Patch mod.

Players can turn on / off this feature at mod menu in edicts tab.
